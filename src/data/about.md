Just an ordinary person with loads of extraordinary dreams.

# Research Interests

I am intrigued by the interplay between decision-making and learning in the realm of computational neuroscience. Unraveling this relationship offers a unique perspective on how our brain processes information, adapts to changes, and formulates choices. Such insights could revolutionize artificial intelligence models, enhancing their capability to mimic and improve human cognitive processes. Other than that, I would love to explore the computational modelling springs from a deep-seated aspiration to enhance the treatment methods for mental health disorders. By employing advanced computational tools, I envision unravelling hidden insights into complex neurological patterns, potentially transforming our approach to psychiatric medication and therapy, and ultimately, creating more adapted, efficient, and personalised solutions for patients.
